## Acknowledgment
Applying Indigenous Data Sovereignty to your work is a method that can assist in the understanding and recognition of Indigenous Peoples rights and relationships with data. It does not serve as the only method of the recognition of Indigenous rights or implementation of protections for Indigenous Peoples’ data. This lesson is positioned as a starting point for understanding ethical concerns that Indigenous Peoples have surrounding their data, wherever it may be located

### Who should take these lessons
Those who should take these lessons include any data actors who encounter, steward, handle, and research within or in collaboration with Indigenous Communities and data. As well, anyone from the Carpentries’ community looking to incorporate Indigenous data sovereignty and governance frameworks into their curriculum, institutions, research, or studies. We would like to invite colleagues, students, multi-disciplinary scholars, and data practitioners to take these lessons as a means of developing a greater understanding of the legal and ethical frameworks nation states applied to recognize or not recognize the Indigenous Peoples who remain in their traditional lands today and existed prior to the colonization of those lands. Others who will find this lesson applicable are mainstream and Indigenous audiences, data stewards and data users from software, research data, library, and beyond who interact with Indigenous data.
